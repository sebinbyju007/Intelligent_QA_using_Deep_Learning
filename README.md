# Intelligent_Sentence_Pair_Similarity_using_Deep_Learning

The project is focused on finding the similarity of two statements. The project is implemented with deep learning technology which includes CNN, BiLSTM and so on. The model is trained on Quora Question Pair Dataset. It used glove.6d file as embedding vector and feature engineering is done on the data. The UI is implemented on Flask micro web framework.
